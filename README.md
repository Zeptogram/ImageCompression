DTC2 Implementation and JPEG-like Compression of grayscale images.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two sub-projects corresponding to the two parts of the assignment and a directory for the images:

- **imgs** » Directory containing the images provided with the assignment.
- **part1** » Sub-project related to the first part of the assignment:
  - Implementation of DCT2
  - Analysis of the DCT2 provided by SciPy and comparison with our version
- **part2** » Sub-project related to the second part of the assignment:
  - Import of a grayscale image
  - Reconstruction of the compressed image after processing

Each project consists of two files:

- `functions.py` which collects all the functions we used as if it were a library for our project
- `main.py` executable of the related sub-project
